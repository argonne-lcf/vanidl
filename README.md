# VaniDL

VaniDL is an tool for analyzing I/O patterns and behavior with Deep Learning Applications. It analyzes Darshan Extended traces to extract various I/O patterns with Deep Learning applications. The tool at it core uses dlprofiler which converts Darshan Profilerâ€™s trace into knowledge for analysis. It is designed to provide low-level I/O behavior details to tensorflow applications in HPC. 

TFLearn features include:

-   Easy-to-use and understand high-level API for implementing deep neural networks, with tutorial and examples.
-   Fast prototyping through highly modular built-in neural network layers, regularizers, optimizers, metrics...
-   Full transparency over Tensorflow. All functions are built over tensors and can be used independently of TFLearn.
-   Powerful helper functions to train any TensorFlow graph, with support of multiple inputs, outputs and optimizers.
-   Easy and beautiful graph visualization, with details about weights, gradients, activations and more...
-   Effortless device placement for using multiple CPU/GPU.
