# VaniDL

VaniDL is an tool for analyzing I/O patterns and behavior with Deep Learning Applications. It analyzes Darshan Extended traces to extract various I/O patterns with Deep Learning applications. The tool at it core uses dlprofiler which converts Darshan Profilerâ€™s trace into knowledge for analysis. It is designed to provide low-level I/O behavior details to tensorflow applications in HPC. 

**TFLearn features include:**

-   Easy-to-use and understand high-level API for extracting I/O behavior of the applications.
-   Fast prototyping through highly modular data representation through pandas for easy plotting of graphs.
-   Full transparency over profiling data with access to internal data structures such as timeline of applications, aggregation functions, and drill up/down data views.
-   Powerful helper functions to build a visual understanding of how applications perform I/O such as request distributions, file access pattern, and extracting file specific summaries.
-   Easy to use File Summary and Job Summary extractors for understanding the data consumed by Deep Learning Applications
